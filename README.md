# PubJack


## Description

This is a gambling game based on blackjack. In the game, you draw cards in turns, and the side close to the 21 points will win. In addition to the blackjack, you can always keep a card in your hand (which also counts for points). Different strategies of showing cards will influence the opponent's decision to continue drawing.

This is the assignment for Fall 2022 - Intro to Game Development Project 3 Part 2.
