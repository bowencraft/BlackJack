# PubJack
A blackjack-like gambling game. In the game, you draw cards in turns, and the side close to the 21 points will win. In addition to the blackjack, you can always keep a card in your hand (which also counts for points). Different strategies of showing cards will influence the opponent's decision to continue drawing.
